 <h1>The best movies according to Vicki</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>The Fountain</h3>

 <p>Tragically beautiful time-and-space-jumping spiritual and existential saga.</p>

 <h3>The Dancer in the Dark</h3>

 <p>Extremely heartbreaking story of a mother losing her sight and her child as a result of terrible circumstances. Bjork is a powerhouse of an actor.</p>

 <h3>Coraline</h3>
 
 <p>Drak and unsettling tale of a young girl who discovers a new dimension where everything is not as it seems. Burton-esque.</p>
